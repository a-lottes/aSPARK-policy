## The Problem

Large enterprises rarely fail for lack of talented developers. They fail because
engineering standards are **inconsistently applied** across projects, teams and
technologies.

Every organization already has the documentation:

- Architecture Guidelines
- Secure Coding Standards
- Naming Conventions
- Cloud Standards
- Release Processes
- Compliance Rules
- Review Checklists

But these live as PDFs, wikis or Confluence pages. They are **read occasionally,
interpreted differently and almost never enforced automatically.**

## The Idea

**aSPARK-policy** transforms those documents into an executable policy layer.

The goal is not to replace your engineering standards — it is to make them
**machine-readable, reusable and enforceable.**

- Markdown files **explain** the standards.
- A `policy.yaml` file **activates** them.
- Every aSPARK agent **consumes** the same policy — no duplicated prompts, no
  custom agent modifications.

---

## Install

aSPARK-policy has two audiences, and they install different things — the same
split aSPARK Core makes between using the plugin and hacking on it.

### For projects adopting a policy (the enterprise path)

A policy is not a package you install — it is a **repository you mount**.
Your organization keeps its standards in its own policy repo; each project
pulls it in as a Git submodule at `.spark/policy`, next to the constitution
and the feature artifacts:

```bash
git submodule add \
  git@github.com:company/engineering-policy.git \
  .spark/policy
```

That is the whole install for a consuming project — no Python, no tooling,
nothing to run. See [Integration](#integration-repository-layer-not-another-plugin)
for the full layout and [How agents discover the policy](#how-agents-discover-the-policy)
for what happens next.

> **Honest limitation:** today this mounts the *content* (standards, rules,
> packs) but nothing enforces it yet — the `aspark-policy validate` CLI and
> the Facilitator/`/charter` binding in aSPARK Core are still open roadmap
> items. Mounting now establishes the convention enforcement will attach to.

### For contributors (working on the format, schemas or packs)

Requires Python ≥3.11 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Not yet published
to a package index — work from a checkout of this repository:

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url> aspark-policy
cd aspark-policy
uv sync --extra dev    # installs into a local .venv
uv run pytest          # 56 tests: schema self-validity, fixtures, all 8 packs
```

What this gets you: the documented format
([`FORMAT-REFERENCE.md`](FORMAT-REFERENCE.md)), three tested JSON Schemas
under `src/aspark_policy/schemas/` you can point any JSON-Schema-aware tool
at, and the built-in `aspark:` pack catalog under `packs/`. There is **no
CLI yet** — no `aspark-policy validate` command, no `[project.scripts]` entry.
See [Project Status](#project-status) for what's still open, and
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the pack-adding workflow.

> **One-line takeaway:** adopting a policy → one `git submodule add` into
> `.spark/policy`. Contributing to the format → clone + `uv sync`. ✅

### Separation of concerns

- aSPARK **Core** defines **how** software is built.
- aspark-**graph** knows **what** has been built.
- aSPARK **Policy** defines **which rules** every project must follow.

The core workflow never changes. Only the policy changes.

## How aSPARK-policy relates to the Constitution and Lenses

aSPARK already has two mechanisms that look similar to policies. They are not
replaced — they are the **integration points**:

| Mechanism | Scope | Decided by | Lives in |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Policy** (this repo) | organization / business unit | the organization, inherited | `.spark/policy/` (submodule) |
| **Constitution** | one project | the user, via `/charter` | `.spark/constitution.md` |
| **Lenses** | one concern (`security`, `api`, …) | activated by the constitution profile | `lenses/` in aSPARK Core |

The rules of engagement:

1. **The constitution stays the single source of truth for a project.** aSPARK's
   design demands that no phase reads configuration from anywhere else — and
   aSPARK-policy respects that. The policy is not a second source of truth; it
   is an **input to the constitution**.
2. **The Facilitator binds the policy during `/charter`.** If
   `.spark/policy/policy.yaml` exists, the Facilitator reads it, records the
   binding (policy name + pinned version) in `constitution.md`, and translates
   policy rules into constitution principles and constraints. From that moment
   every phase inherits them the normal way — no new plumbing.
3. **Policies can activate lenses.** A policy import like `aspark:security`
   does not duplicate the security lens — it *switches it on* in the project
   profile, exactly as if the user had confirmed it during `/charter`. Policy
   rules that go beyond a lens (e.g. `minimum_reviewers: 2`) become
   constitution constraints.
4. **The user sees every binding.** `/charter` shows what the policy activates
   and where it constrains the project. Organization rules marked `final`
   (see [Inheritance](#policy-inheritance)) cannot be overridden locally; all
   others can be tightened per project.

This keeps the layering clean: **Policy = what the organization requires.
Constitution = what this project decided. Lenses = how a concern is checked.**

---

## How It Works

Instead of writing engineering standards only as documentation, organizations
define them as reusable policy packages.

```
company-engineering-policy/
├── architecture.md
├── security.md
├── testing.md
├── release.md
├── naming.md
├── cloud.md
└── policy.yaml        # activates the standards above
```

### Example `policy.yaml`

```yaml
schema_version: 1          # version of the policy.yaml format itself
                           # (the package version is the Git tag of this repo)

name: ACME Enterprise Policy

imports:
  - aspark:security        # built-in packs use the aspark: prefix
  - aspark:api
  - aspark:library

rules:
  review:
    minimum_reviewers: 2

  qa:
    browser_testing: required

  release:
    requires_qa: true

  architecture:
    adr_required: true

  security:
    id: SEC-014             # stable rule identifier
    severity: blocking      # info | warning | blocking — only blocking stops a gate
    scope: "**/*"           # glob: which files/paths this rule applies to
    check: static           # static | artifact | graph-query
    owasp_top10: true
    final: true             # locked — lower levels cannot weaken this block

  code:
    java:
      version: 21
    typescript:
      strict: true
    python:
      formatter: ruff
```

Every aSPARK agent receives exactly the same policy configuration.

### Import namespaces

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `aspark:<pack>` | a built-in pack shipped with aSPARK-policy (e.g. `aspark:security`) |
| `company:<pack>` | a pack defined inside the same policy repository |
| `git@github.com:org/repo.git#<tag>` | an external policy repository, pinned to a tag |

---

## Integration: Repository Layer, not another Plugin

aSPARK-policy is deliberately **not** built as another plugin next to aSPARK.
It is a **repository layer** that each project optionally includes — the same
idea behind Maven BOMs, Terraform modules and GitHub Actions: the core stays
small, and organizations ship their own standards.

### Recommended: Git Submodule

Keep policies in their own repository and pull them into each project under
`.spark/policy` — inside the `.spark/` tree that aSPARK already owns, next to
the constitution and the feature artifacts:

```
my-project/
├── src/
├── tests/
└── .spark/
    ├── constitution.md        ← written by /charter, binds the policy
    ├── policy/                ← git submodule → company policy repo
    │   ├── architecture.md
    │   ├── security.md
    │   ├── review.md
    │   └── policy.yaml
    └── <feature-name>/
        ├── spec.md
        └── ...
```

```bash
git submodule add \
  git@github.com:company/engineering-policy.git \
  .spark/policy
```

**Advantages**

- Versionable — the submodule pins an exact commit; upgrades are deliberate
- Changes flow through pull requests
- Rollback possible
- Multiple projects share the same policy

The policy repository becomes the **single source of truth for the
organization's standards** — while each project's constitution remains the
single source of truth for what that project runs with.

```
Project A
Project B   ──►   company-engineering-policy
Project C
```

> aSPARK itself should never contain company-specific knowledge. Organizations
> own their engineering standards.

### How agents discover the policy

There is exactly one discovery path, and it runs through the constitution:

1. `/charter` checks for `.spark/policy/policy.yaml`.
2. If present, the Facilitator resolves imports and inheritance, shows the
   effective rule set to the user, and records the binding in
   `constitution.md`.
3. Every other phase reads the constitution — as it already does today. No
   skill or agent gains a second configuration source.
4. If the submodule commit changes (policy upgrade), the next `/charter` run
   re-binds and shows the diff; until then the constitution honestly reflects
   the version the project was chartered against.

---

## Policy Inheritance

Large organizations rarely have one global standard — they have layers.

```
aSPARK Default
      │
Corporate Standard   →   Contoso
      │
Business Unit        →   Financial Services
      │
Department           →   Payments
      │
Project              →   Payment API
```

### Merge semantics

Predictable rules instead of interpretation:

| Case | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Scalar set on two levels | the **more specific level wins** (project beats department beats corporate) |
| Lists (e.g. approved dependencies) | **merged** across levels; a level may replace instead with `!override` |
| Block marked `final: true` | **locked** — lower levels may tighten it, never weaken or remove it |
| Rule only on one level | inherited unchanged |

Example — corporate locks security, the project tightens review:

```yaml
# corporate/policy.yaml
rules:
  security:
    owasp_top10: true
    final: true            # no BU, department or project can turn this off
  review:
    minimum_reviewers: 1

# payment-api/policy.yaml
extends: corporate
rules:
  review:
    minimum_reviewers: 2   # tightening is always allowed
```

`final` exists for the compliance case: a regulated organization must be able
to guarantee that a rule holds in *every* project, without auditing each one.

---

## Policy Packs

Reusable bundles simplify adoption. A project **combines packs across several
axes** — compliance, architecture, language, framework, cloud, platform — and
no custom agents are required. aSPARK-policy ships a catalog of built-in packs
(the `aspark:` namespace); organizations add their own (`company:`).

### The built-in catalog

Packs are grouped **by category on disk** (for maintainers), but every import
id stays **flat** (for users): `aspark:owasp`, not `aspark:compliance/owasp`.

```
packs/
├── compliance/     iso27001 · owasp
├── architecture/   clean-architecture
├── language/       java
├── framework/      spring · react
├── cloud/          aws · azure
└── platform/       sap
```

```yaml
imports:
  - aspark:owasp       # compliance/security
  - aspark:java        # language baseline
  - aspark:spring      # framework baseline
  - aspark:aws         # cloud baseline
  - company:acme-naming
```

### Two kinds of pack

The distinction matters because it decides what may be locked:

| Kind | Meaning | May be `final`? | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **universal** | the same for every organization — an external standard | yes | `owasp`, `iso27001` |
| **baseline** | an opinionated starting point, meant to be overridden per org | no | `java`, `spring`, `react`, `aws`, `azure`, `sap`, `clean-architecture` |

A universal pack (OWASP Top 10) is a fact of the industry, so a corporate level
may lock it. A baseline pack that pins *Java 21* is a **default, not a
standard** — every organization has its own conventions, so a baseline is a
scaffold to tighten, never a `final` constraint.

### What each pack binds to

Some packs switch on an existing aSPARK lens; some are plain rule-sets that feed
an existing agent directly:

| Pack | Category | Kind | Binds to |
|---|---|---|---|
| **owasp** | compliance | universal | existing `security` lens |
| **iso27001** | compliance | universal | Product Owner compliance + several lenses |
| **clean-architecture** | architecture | baseline | Engineering Manager / Reviewer — *no lens today* |
| **java** | language | baseline | Developer (`code.java`) |
| **spring** | framework | baseline | Developer |
| **react** | framework | baseline | Developer + existing `ux` lens |
| **aws** | cloud | baseline | Engineering Manager — *no lens today* |
| **azure** | cloud | baseline | Engineering Manager — *no lens today* |
| **sap** | platform | baseline | Engineering Manager / Developer |

> **This catalog reveals two gaps in aSPARK Core:** there is no `cloud` lens and
> no `architecture` lens yet. Until they exist, `aws`/`azure`/`clean-architecture`
> apply as plain constitution constraints on the existing agents. Adding those
> two lenses to aSPARK Core is the natural follow-up (tracked in
> [Project Status](#project-status)).

### Anatomy of a pack

```
packs/compliance/owasp/
├── pack.yaml       # metadata: id, category, kind, version, maps_to_lens, summary, references
├── security.md     # the human-readable standard
└── policy.yaml     # the rule fragment this pack contributes
```

When two packs set the same key (two frameworks, two clouds), the
[merge and `final` semantics](#merge-semantics) resolve it deterministically —
so `pack.yaml` makes each pack's category and kind explicit rather than leaving
conflicts to interpretation.

---

## Agent Integration

The policy engine does not create new roles. All **seven** existing aSPARK
agents consume the same policies, each in the phase they own:

| Command | Agent | Uses the policy to … |
|---|---|---|
| `/charter` | 📜 **Facilitator** | Bind the policy into the constitution; resolve imports, inheritance and lens activation; show the user the effective rule set |
| `/story-time` | 🧭 **Product Owner** | Check mandatory NFRs, compliance, legal and privacy requirements |
| `/look-and-feel` | 🎨 **Designer** | Apply accessibility standards, design-system and UX policies |
| `/sprint-plan` | 🏗️ **Engineering Manager** | Check architecture principles, approved frameworks, dependency & cloud rules |
| `/increment` | 💻 **Developer** | Apply coding conventions, language standards, testing & documentation rules |
| `/peer-review` | 🔍 **Reviewer** | Enforce architecture, security, dependency restrictions, clean code |
| `/demo-day` | 🧪 **QA Tester** | Verify regulatory, accessibility, security and operational requirements |
| `/go-live` | 🚀 **Release Manager** | Block releases when required policies are missing |

### Release gate example

```
Release blocked

✔ Review complete
✔ QA passed
✘ Security approval missing            (policy: ACME Enterprise → security)
✘ Architecture Decision Record missing (policy: ACME Enterprise → architecture.adr_required)
```

### Policy violations become explicit

```
Policy Violations

✘ Architecture Decision Record missing
✘ Public API not versioned
✘ Logging standard violated
✘ Naming convention violated
✘ Required NFR missing
✘ Dependency not approved
```

Policies become quality gates instead of advisory documents — and every
violation names the policy and rule it comes from, which is what makes the
trail auditable.

---

## Relationship with aspark-graph (planned)

[aspark-graph](https://github.com/a-lottes/aSPARK-graph) today models code
(`File`, `Class`, `Function`) and delivery artifacts (`Feature`, `Story`,
`AcceptanceCriterion`, `Task`, `Finding`, `QACheck`) — **it has no policy
layer yet**. Extending it is the natural next step, not a current capability:

- A `Policy` / `PolicyViolation` node type would let violations join the graph
  the same way review findings (`Finding`) already do.
- `gate_health` — the existing query that answers *"are this feature's ACs
  covered and passing?"* — is the natural anchor point for policy gates.

Once that exists, the two together can answer:

- Which stories violate architecture policy?
- Which NFRs required by policy are missing?
- Which release is blocked by governance, and by exactly which rule?
- Which code changes require additional approvals?

The policy engine defines the rules; the graph verifies traceability.

## Benefits for Enterprises

| Benefit               | What it means                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Consistency**       | Every project follows the same engineering standards       |
| **Reuse**             | Engineering knowledge is written once, reused everywhere   |
| **Compliance**        | Policies become enforceable instead of advisory            |
| **Lower onboarding**  | New teams automatically inherit company standards          |
| **Auditability**      | Every decision traces back to an explicit policy           |
| **Scalability**       | Thousands of projects can share one engineering standard   |

## Project Status

aSPARK-policy is in **early development, not yet released**. This README is
the design document; it always reflects the current state honestly.

- [x] Vision, positioning in the product family, separation of concerns
- [x] Integration design: repository layer via Git submodule at `.spark/policy`
- [x] Constitution binding designed — `/charter` as the single discovery path,
      no second source of truth
- [x] Inheritance semantics defined — specific-wins, list merging, `final` lock
- [x] Pack catalog designed — categories, universal vs. baseline, per-pack
      lens binding; `owasp` scaffolded under `packs/` as the reference pack
- [x] `policy.yaml` / `pack.yaml` schema (JSON Schema, draft 2020-12) —
      formal, validatable definition under `src/aspark_policy/schemas/`;
      validates all four format fixtures and all 8 shipped packs clean
- [x] Rule anatomy — optional `id`/`severity`/`scope`/`check` on any rule
      block, aligned with the aSPARK Enterprise Architecture Handbook's
      vision; `check: graph-query` is structural only until aSPARK-graph
      integrates
- [ ] `aspark-policy validate` CLI — lint a policy repo standalone and in CI
- [ ] Facilitator/`/charter` integration in aSPARK Core — read, resolve and
      bind `.spark/policy/policy.yaml`
- [ ] Fill the built-in catalog — `iso27001`, `clean-architecture`, `java`,
      `spring`, `react`, `aws`, `azure` are authored; only `sap` remains
      (excluded so far: no verified SAP source material to author credibly)
- [ ] New lenses in aSPARK Core — `cloud` and `architecture`, so `aws`/`azure`/
      `clean-architecture` bind to a lens instead of plain constraints
- [ ] Per-phase policy enforcement wired into the remaining seven skills
- [ ] Policy node types in aspark-graph (`Policy`, `PolicyViolation`) +
      `gate_health` extension
- [ ] Reference policy repository as a template (`company-engineering-policy`)

## Future Extensions

Enterprise modules can be independently versioned and maintained:

- ISO 27001 Policy Pack
- OWASP Policy Pack
- NIST Policy Pack
- Automotive SPICE Pack
- MISRA Pack
- Medical Device Pack
- GDPR Pack
- Internal Corporate Packs

---

## Vision

aSPARK-policy transforms engineering governance from static documentation into
executable organizational knowledge. Instead of teaching every engineer and
every AI agent how a company develops software, organizations publish their
standards once as reusable policy packages.

Every project, every repository and every aSPARK agent then follows the same
rules automatically — a scalable, deterministic and auditable software
engineering platform that combines delivery process, knowledge management and
enterprise governance while minimizing operational overhead, reducing costs and
consistently delivering high-quality software.
